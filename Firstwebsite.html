    <h2>The <strong>Parent's</strong> guide to the Internet</h2>
        <h5>By John Champagne, 4/20/2018</h5>
        <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>If you're a clueless parent who is wondering what that devil machine that your kid is always on actually does, well, you've come to the right place!<br>With one quick read of this guide, not only will you be aware of the harsh influences affecting your children, you will be able to combat <br> and prevent your child from ever being exposed to them!</p>
        
        <p>There are many little demons beckoning to your child to attempt horrible deeds, but there are a few that stand out. <br> These include, Coded language -usually in the form of acronyms-, HaHa's, and Youvideo!! To help defeet these monsers, <br> we must understand what they are and the steps needed to be taken against them.</p>
        <h4>The Letter Words</h4>

        <p>To avoid detection by knowledgable parents, the pedofiles over the internet have convinced our youth to communicate <br> in coded language. Instead of speaking American, they instead use heathen acronyms, which stand for ghastly requests.<br> For example, LOL is one of the most widely spread of these brainwashing tools. Though it's meaning is still widely debated within <br> parenting communities, it is thought to originate from satanic worship. The O is symbolic of our dear children's head, with the L's <br> representing their arm's clawing away at a desperate attempt at escaping from a life of petty crime, and marijuana usage.</p>
        
        <p>These letter groups serve as the front-line of the electronic onslaught. While they lose their effectiveness in exchange for being the most widespread of <br> electro-brainwashing, they serve as a gateway drug of sorts to the world behind the glowing screen. Once completely embedded in our poor youngling's <br> vocabulary, they introduce them to a far more potent weapon: <strong>The Haha</strong>.</p>
        
        <h4>The Haha</h4>

        <h6>*Pictured above, a deranged man laughing at air, possibly due to overexposure to hahas*</h6>
        
        <p>Hahas are far more advanced tools of mass subjugation than simple *CENSORED*. Thought to orignate from World War II Nazi propoganda techniques<br> and torture methods, hahas are the illustration of the evil that *CENSORED* try to describe through words. While they indoctrinate are youth far <br> more effectively, they are more easily identified. This weakness allows to stop them far earlier than *CENSORED*, if they are knowledgeable. <br> However, they must be caught early in the child's development, for if they are ingrained in their daily habits, they are almost impossible to remove, <br> like a tumor that slowly grows until it is inseperable from its poor pubescent host. Parents must also be aware, for Hahas are far more likely to <br> jump species, infecting parents, and on rare occasions, even grandpooper and poor old grandma.
        
        <h4> The MeMovies </h4>

        <p>The Youwatchs are the tip of the spear for the mass computational enslavement of our youth. They are motion  pictures surgically designed to physically elicit the darkest <br> humor out of our very beings and utilize that repressed sin to compel us to obey the compooter's every whim. They are capable of so much destruction. <br> Even the most stead fast of parents can fall into their grasp, simply due to the sheer provacativeness they emit. But just like Haha's, parents must be <br> alert to make sure that little johnny never is exposed to such vile creation, lest they fall like so many poor others. While they may be powerful, <br> they can be defeated with the right precautions and proper viligance.
